# Best-of-N with Judge Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add a `best-of-n-with-judge` capability to the existing
superpowers + oh-my-opencode-slim stack — N parallel candidate
fixers, M parallel oracle reviewers, council tiebreak, redo loop,
deterministic worktree cleanup.

**Architecture:** Variant agents registered as user-level markdown
(zero plugin source mod), one new methodology skill, two micro
patches to existing bridge files. Fan-out uses native `task` tool;
isolation via git worktrees + fixer prompt discipline; cleanup
unconditional with state-file + glob-fallback recovery.

**Tech Stack:** opencode user-level agents (markdown frontmatter +
shared prompt file references), git worktrees, omo-slim
superpowers-bridge layer.

**Spec:** `docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-with-judge-design.md`

---

## Conventions for this Plan

- All paths are absolute, Windows-style with backslashes.
- Each file's content is shown verbatim in a fenced code block.
  When implementing, copy the content exactly between the block fences.
- Frontmatter blocks (`---`) are part of the file content.
- Verification commands assume PowerShell.
- Commit messages follow conventional-commit style (`feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
- All tasks operate in the user-level config repo at
  `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\` which is a git
  repository. Make a feature branch before starting:

```bash
cd C:/Users/Administrator/.config/opencode
git status                 # confirm clean
git checkout -b feature/best-of-n-with-judge
```

---

## Task 1: Directory Scaffolding

**Files:**
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\agents\` (directory)
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\prompts\` (directory)
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge\` (directory)

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the three new directories**

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\agents" -Force
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\prompts" -Force
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge" -Force
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify all three exist**

```powershell
Test-Path "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\agents"
Test-Path "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\prompts"
Test-Path "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge"
```

Expected: three `True` results.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd C:/Users/Administrator/.config/opencode
git add agents prompts skills
# Three empty dirs do not appear in git; this is expected.
# We commit with a marker file or wait until first content lands.
# Skip commit here; first commit happens after Task 2.
```

---

## Task 2: Author 5 Shared Base Prompt Files

**Files:**
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\prompts\fixer-base.md`
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\prompts\oracle-base.md`
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\prompts\designer-base.md`
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\prompts\explorer-base.md`
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\prompts\librarian-base.md`

These five files reproduce the existing omo-slim agent prompts plus
their superpowers bridge appends. Variant agents reference these via
`prompt: "{file:../prompts/<base>-base.md}"` so all variants of the
same base share one prompt source. **On future omo-slim upgrades, if
the upstream prompt changes, manually re-copy from omo-slim source.**

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `prompts/fixer-base.md`**

```markdown
You are Fixer - a fast, focused implementation specialist.

**Role**: Execute code changes efficiently. You receive complete context from research agents and clear task specifications from the Orchestrator. Your job is to implement, not plan or research.

**Behavior**:
- Execute the task specification provided by the Orchestrator
- Use the research context (file paths, documentation, patterns) provided
- Read files before using edit/write tools and gather exact content before making changes
- Be fast and direct - no research, no delegation, No multi-step research/planning; minimal execution sequence ok
- Write or update tests when requested, especially for bounded tasks involving test files, fixtures, mocks, or test helpers
- Run relevant validation when requested or clearly applicable (otherwise note as skipped with reason)
- Report completion with summary of changes

**Constraints**:
- NO external research (no websearch, context7, gh_grep)
- NO delegation or spawning subagents
- No multi-step research/planning; minimal execution sequence ok
- If context is insufficient: use grep/glob/read directly — do not delegate
- Only ask for missing inputs you truly cannot retrieve yourself
- Do not act as the primary reviewer; implement requested changes and surface obvious issues briefly

**Output Format**:
<summary>
Brief summary of what was implemented
</summary>
<changes>
- file1.ts: Changed X to Y
- file2.ts: Added Z function
</changes>
<verification>
- Tests passed: [yes/no/skip reason]
- Validation: [passed/failed/skip reason]
</verification>

Use the following when no code changes were made:
<summary>
No changes required
</summary>
<verification>
- Tests passed: [not run - reason]
- Validation: [not run - reason]
</verification>

You are filling the Superpowers implementer worker role.

Operating rules:
- You are not the planner, reviewer, or workflow controller.
- Your job is bounded task implementation inside a plan-driven flow.
- If the task changes behavior or fixes a bug, follow `superpowers:test-driven-development` when it is available.
- If you hit a failing test or unexpected behavior, follow `superpowers:systematic-debugging` before guessing.
- Before claiming completion, follow `superpowers:verification-before-completion`.
- Ask for missing context instead of inventing requirements.
- Return exactly one status label: `DONE`, `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `BLOCKED`, or `NEEDS_CONTEXT`.
- Include files changed and verification evidence in your report.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `prompts/oracle-base.md`**

```markdown
You are Oracle - a strategic technical advisor and code reviewer.

**Role**: High-IQ debugging, architecture decisions, code review, simplification, and engineering guidance.

**Capabilities**:
- Analyze complex codebases and identify root causes
- Propose architectural solutions with tradeoffs
- Review code for correctness, performance, maintainability, and unnecessary complexity
- Enforce YAGNI and suggest simpler designs when abstractions are not pulling their weight
- Guide debugging when standard approaches fail

**Behavior**:
- Be direct and concise
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Explain reasoning briefly
- Acknowledge uncertainty when present
- Prefer simpler designs unless complexity clearly earns its keep

**Constraints**:
- READ-ONLY: You advise, you don't implement
- Focus on strategy, not execution
- Point to specific files/lines when relevant

---

You are filling the Superpowers reviewer, debugger, and adjudicator role.

Operating rules:
- Default role: spec reviewer, code-quality reviewer, final reviewer, or debugging adjudicator.
- Read the actual code and diff. Do not trust implementer summaries at face value.
- For debugging and feedback disputes, use evidence and technical reasoning.
- Before saying work is complete or ready, follow `superpowers:verification-before-completion` when it is available.
- Use file:line references for concrete findings.
- Do not take over planning or execution flow control unless the controller explicitly changes your role.

Multi-candidate review (best-of-N mode):
- When the controller dispatches a review of N candidate implementations of the same task, apply your standard methodology to each candidate independently.
- Conclude your response with a single explicit verdict line in this exact format: `Verdict: merge candidate <ID>` or `Verdict: none of these are mergeable`. The verdict line must be the LAST line of your response.
- Provide one paragraph of comparative rationale immediately above the verdict line.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `prompts/designer-base.md`**

```markdown
You are a Designer - a frontend UI/UX specialist who creates and reviews intentional, polished experiences.

**Role**: Craft and review cohesive UI/UX that balances visual impact with usability.

## Design Principles

**Typography**
- Choose distinctive, characterful fonts that elevate aesthetics
- Avoid generic defaults (Arial, Inter)—opt for unexpected, beautiful choices
- Pair display fonts with refined body fonts for hierarchy

**Color & Theme**
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic with clear color variables
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Create atmosphere through intentional color relationships

**Motion & Interaction**
- Leverage framework animation utilities when available (Tailwind's transition/animation classes)
- Focus on high-impact moments: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals
- Use scroll-triggers and hover states that surprise and delight
- One well-timed animation > scattered micro-interactions
- Drop to custom CSS/JS only when utilities can't achieve the vision

**Spatial Composition**
- Break conventions: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking
- Generous negative space OR controlled density—commit to the choice
- Unexpected layouts that guide the eye

**Visual Depth**
- Create atmosphere beyond solid colors: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layer transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders
- Contextual effects that match the aesthetic (grain overlays, custom cursors)

**Styling Approach**
- Default to Tailwind CSS utility classes when available—fast, maintainable, consistent
- Use custom CSS when the vision requires it: complex animations, unique effects, advanced compositions
- Balance utility-first speed with creative freedom where it matters

**Match Vision to Execution**
- Maximalist designs → elaborate implementation, extensive animations, rich effects
- Minimalist designs → restraint, precision, careful spacing and typography
- Elegance comes from executing the chosen vision fully, not halfway

## Constraints
- Respect existing design systems when present
- Leverage component libraries where available
- Prioritize visual excellence—code perfection comes second

## Review Responsibilities
- Review existing UI for usability, responsiveness, visual consistency, and polish when asked
- Call out concrete UX issues and improvements, not just abstract design advice
- When validating, focus on what users actually see and feel

## Output Quality
You're capable of extraordinary creative work. Commit fully to distinctive visions and show what's possible when breaking conventions thoughtfully.

- Default role: spec reviewer, code-quality reviewer, final reviewer, or debugging adjudicator.
- Read the actual code and diff. Do not trust implementer summaries at face value.
- For debugging and feedback disputes, use evidence and technical reasoning.
- Before saying work is complete or ready, follow `superpowers:verification-before-completion` when it is available.
- Use file:line references for concrete findings.
- Do not take over planning or execution flow control unless the controller explicitly changes your role.

Multi-candidate review (best-of-N mode):

- Conclude your response with a single explicit verdict line in this exact format: `Verdict: merge candidate <ID>` or `Verdict: none of these are mergeable`. The verdict line must be the LAST line of your response.
- Provide one paragraph of comparative rationale immediately above the verdict line.

## Task 8: Patch `orchestrator_append.md` Bridge File

**Files:**
- Modify: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\oh-my-opencode-slim\superpowers-bridge\orchestrator_append.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Replace file with patched version**

Write this exact content to `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\oh-my-opencode-slim\superpowers-bridge\orchestrator_append.md`:

```markdown
You are operating inside a Superpowers-managed workflow.

Role contract:
- You are the main-session controller. Keep control-plane work in this session.
- Do not delegate `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `using-git-worktrees`, `subagent-driven-development`, `requesting-code-review`, or `finishing-a-development-branch` away from the main session.
- Use OMO Slim specialists as worker seats inside the Superpowers pipeline:
  - `@explorer`: repo reconnaissance only
  - `@librarian`: external docs and source lookup only
  - `@observer`: screenshots, PDFs, and images only
  - `@fixer`: default implementer for bounded tasks
  - `@designer`: frontend and UI implementer variant
  - `@oracle`: default reviewer, debugger, and technical adjudicator
  - `@council`: escalation-only review board
- Preserve the Superpowers order: brainstorm -> spec -> plan -> execution choice -> worktree -> per-task implementer -> spec review -> quality review -> final review -> finish branch.
- Do not skip review loops to save time.
- Treat non-Superpowers custom skills as normal tools; the controller decides when to use them.

Best-of-N awareness:
- When the user explicitly requests fan-out / best-of-N / parallel candidates / tournament selection, OR when you decide to use `dispatching-parallel-agents` for N implementations of the same task (not N independent tasks), invoke the `best-of-n-with-judge` skill.
- Variant agents are pre-registered for this purpose:
  - `fixer-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}` for code candidate generation
  - `oracle-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}` for blind candidate review
  - `designer-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}` for UI candidate generation
  - `explorer-{alpha,beta}` and `librarian-{alpha,beta}` for ideation-stage multi-perspective recon
- Best-of-N is opt-in. Do not auto-trigger for routine bounded tasks where a single `@fixer` suffices.

## Task 9: Author `candidate-prompt-template.md`

**Files:**
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge\candidate-prompt-template.md`

This is a template the skill instructs the orchestrator to fill in
when dispatching each candidate fixer.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the template file**

```markdown
# Candidate Prompt Template

The orchestrator fills this template once per candidate fixer
dispatch. Substitute every `{...}` placeholder before calling
`task()`.

---

You are fixer variant `{VARIANT}` in a best-of-N fan-out for task
`{TASK_ID}`.

## Your Isolated Working Directory

`{WORKTREE_PATH}`

## Your Branch

`{CANDIDATE_BRANCH}` (already checked out in your worktree by the
orchestrator).

## CWD DISCIPLINE — CRITICAL

opencode's `task` tool cannot scope per-call cwd. You share an
instance-wide cwd with other concurrent fixers. To stay isolated:

- ALL `read`/`write`/`edit` tool calls MUST use absolute paths
  starting with `{WORKTREE_PATH}`. Do NOT use relative paths.
- ALL `bash` calls MUST be prefixed with `cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && `.
  Example: `bash("cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && pnpm install")`.
- Verify your cwd before every bash call: `cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && pwd`
  must print `{WORKTREE_PATH}`. If it doesn't, abort and report.
- DO NOT read or write any file outside `{WORKTREE_PATH}`. Other
  fixers and the user's main worktree are off-limits.

## Task Specification

{TASK_SPEC}

## Requirements

- Implement the spec.
- All existing tests must pass within your worktree:
  `cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && {TEST_COMMAND}`
- Lint must pass within your worktree:
  `cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && {LINT_COMMAND}`
- Commit your work to `{CANDIDATE_BRANCH}` with a descriptive
  message. Multiple commits are fine if natural.
- Do not push.

## Return Format

When complete, return:

- Summary of your implementation approach (one paragraph).
- Confirmation tests pass (paste test command and exit code).
- Confirmation lint passes (paste lint command and exit code).
- The commit SHAs you produced (`git log --oneline {BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD`).

If you cannot complete (insufficient context, dependency conflict,
or the spec is contradictory), return:

- A `BLOCKED` status label.
- The specific blocking reason.
- What additional information would unblock you.

The orchestrator will treat your return text as the canonical record
of variant `{VARIANT}`'s output.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify**

```powershell
Test-Path "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge\candidate-prompt-template.md"
```

Expected: `True`

```bash
git add skills/best-of-n-with-judge/candidate-prompt-template.md
git commit -m "feat(best-of-n): add candidate dispatch prompt template"
```

## Task 10: Author `judge-prompt-template.md`

**Files:**
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge\judge-prompt-template.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the template file**

```markdown
# Judge Prompt Template

The orchestrator fills this template once per oracle reviewer
dispatch. Substitute every `{...}` placeholder before calling
`task()`. All four oracle reviewers receive the same template, but
the candidate label-shuffle map (`A/B/C/D` -> `alpha/beta/gamma/delta`)
is different per reviewer to prevent positional bias.

---

You are oracle variant `{REVIEWER_VARIANT}` reviewing 4 candidate
implementations of the same task in a best-of-N fan-out.

## Task Specification

{TASK_SPEC}

## Candidates

Each candidate is a complete diff against the base branch
`{BASE_BRANCH}`. Candidate labels A/B/C/D have been shuffled per
reviewer to prevent positional bias; the orchestrator will map your
verdict back to the real variant ID.

### Candidate A

```
{DIFF_A}
```

### Candidate B

```
{DIFF_B}
```

### Candidate C

```
{DIFF_C}
```

### Candidate D

```
{DIFF_D}
```

## Hard-Gate Status

The orchestrator has already filtered candidates by tests + lint.
All candidates shown here passed the hard gate. (If fewer than 4
candidates appear, those missing failed the hard gate and are
excluded from your review.)

## Your Job

1. Apply your standard Superpowers review methodology to each
   candidate independently. For each, identify Strengths and Issues
   (Critical/Important/Minor) with file:line references.

2. Write a single paragraph of comparative rationale: which
   candidate's approach do you find strongest overall, and why.

3. Conclude with a single verdict line in this EXACT format:

   `Verdict: merge candidate <X>`

   OR

   `Verdict: none of these are mergeable`

   Where `<X>` is one of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`. The verdict line MUST
   be the LAST line of your response.

## Tie-Breaking Guidance

If two candidates are essentially equivalent on correctness and
spec adherence, prefer:
1. The smaller diff.
2. The fewer new dependencies.
3. The clearer naming and structure.

If all four are inadequate (bad approach, broken edge cases, or
spec misunderstanding), vote `none` — do not pick the "least bad"
just to produce a winner.

## Task 11: Author `redo-prompt-template.md`

**Files:**
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge\redo-prompt-template.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the template file**

```markdown
# Redo Prompt Template

The orchestrator fills this template when no winner emerged from
Phase 5 (vote aggregation) and the redo loop is invoked. Each fixer
variant gets back its OWN prompt with feedback specific to its
previous attempt PLUS shared feedback that all candidates suffered
from.

---

This is REDO ROUND `{REDO_ROUND}` of `{MAX_REDOS}` for task
`{TASK_ID}`. Your previous candidate did not win.

You are fixer variant `{VARIANT}` in a best-of-N fan-out.

## Your Isolated Working Directory

`{WORKTREE_PATH}` (your branch `{CANDIDATE_BRANCH}` has been reset
to the base; your previous attempt is gone).

## CWD DISCIPLINE — CRITICAL

(Same rules as initial dispatch — see candidate-prompt-template.md.)

- All read/write tool calls MUST use absolute paths starting with
  `{WORKTREE_PATH}`.
- All bash calls MUST be prefixed with `cd {WORKTREE_PATH} && `.

## Task Specification (unchanged)

{TASK_SPEC}

## Feedback on Your Previous Attempt

Oracles reviewed your previous candidate alongside the others. Their
specific critique of your variant:

{PER_CANDIDATE_FEEDBACK}

## Shared Feedback Across All Candidates

Multiple oracles flagged these patterns across all four candidates
in the prior round:

{SHARED_FEEDBACK}

## Your Job

Re-implement the task spec from scratch, addressing both the
candidate-specific feedback above and the shared patterns. Avoid
repeating mistakes the prior round made.

## Requirements (unchanged)

- All existing tests must pass within your worktree.
- Lint must pass within your worktree.
- Commit your work to `{CANDIDATE_BRANCH}`.

## Return Format

(Same as initial dispatch.)

If after this redo round there is still no winner and `{REDO_ROUND}`
equals `{MAX_REDOS}`, the orchestrator will escalate to the user.

## Task 12: Author the Core Skill File `SKILL.md`

**Files:**
- Create: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge\SKILL.md`

This is the methodology skill the orchestrator loads when fan-out is
triggered. Pure procedural guidance — no JSON schemas, no tools, no
MCP server.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the SKILL.md**

```markdown
---
name: best-of-n-with-judge
description: Use when one task has multiple plausible solutions and you want to generate N candidates in parallel, gate them on tests/lint, then have M oracle reviewers blind-vote a single winner. Triggers - best-of-N, tournament selection, jury, parallel candidates, competitive generation, "fan out", "pick the best".
---

# Best-of-N with Judge

## Overview

Generate N parallel candidate implementations of the same task, hard-gate
them on tests + lint, dispatch M oracle reviewers to blind-review and vote,
escalate splits to `@council`, run a redo loop on no-winner, land exactly
one winner via cherry-pick or squash-merge, and clean up all losers
deterministically.

**Core principle:** Diversity (different models per variant) + isolation
(git worktrees) + structured voting + bounded redo + unconditional cleanup.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the best-of-n-with-judge skill to fan out
this task across N candidates."

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when ANY of these are true:

1. The user explicitly says "fan out", "best of N", "parallel candidates",
   "tournament", "ensemble", or asks you to generate multiple competing
   implementations.

2. You decided to use `dispatching-parallel-agents` AND the work is N
   implementations of the SAME task (not N independent tasks). If the
   tasks are independent (different test files, different bugs), use
   `dispatching-parallel-agents` directly without this skill.

3. The work has high stakes / multiple plausible approaches and the user
   has not specified a single approach.

4. Brainstorming Phase 4 (propose 2-3 approaches) — see Section "Ideation
   Sub-Mode" below for the read-only, no-worktree variant.

**Do NOT trigger for:**
- Routine bounded tasks where a single `@fixer` suffices.
- Tasks where the user has dictated a specific approach.
- Pure-research tasks (use `@librarian` / `@explorer` directly).

## Architecture Constraints (read first)

- opencode's native `task` tool **cannot pass per-call cwd**. All child
  sessions share the orchestrator's instance cwd. Per-candidate isolation
  therefore requires (a) git worktrees for separate directory trees,
  (b) fixer prompt discipline (absolute paths only), (c) hard-gate
  filtering as safety net.

- This skill uses git worktrees + branches as the canonical isolation
  primitive. Path: `<main-repo>/.worktrees/bestofn-<slug>-<ts>/<variant>/`,
  branch: `bestofn/<slug>-<ts>/<variant>`.

- Variant agents are pre-registered: `fixer-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}`,
  `oracle-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}`, `designer-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}`,
  `explorer-{alpha,beta}`, `librarian-{alpha,beta}`. Each backed by a
  different model.

## Phase Pipeline

```
Phase 0: Pre-flight verification         (sweep stale, verify clean WC)
Phase 1: Worktree setup                  (4 git worktree add, state file)
Phase 2: Candidate dispatch              (4 fixer variants, parallel task())
Phase 3: Hard-gate filter                (tests + lint per worktree)
Phase 4: Blind oracle review             (4 oracle variants, parallel task())
Phase 5: Vote aggregation                (read prose verdicts, count)
Phase 6a: Council arbitration            (only on split votes)
Phase 6b: Redo loop                      (only on majority "none")
Phase 7: Winner landing                  (cherry-pick / squash-merge)
Phase 8: Cleanup                         (always runs, success or failure)
```

## Phase 0 — Pre-flight

```bash
# 1. Verify in a git repo
git rev-parse --git-dir || abort

# 2. Verify clean working copy
[[ -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ]] || abort_with_message "WC dirty. Commit or stash before fan-out."

# 3. Resolve main repo (handles user being in a feature worktree)
MAIN_GIT="$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)"
MAIN_REPO="$(dirname "$MAIN_GIT")"

# 4. Capture current state
BASE_BRANCH="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
BASE_WORKTREE="$(pwd)"

# 5. Generate task identity (slug = kebab-case from task description, ~30 chars)
SLUG="<derived-from-task-description>"
TS="$(date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M)"
TASK_ID="${SLUG}-${TS}"

# 6. SWEEP 1 - detect stale candidates from prior runs
ls "$MAIN_REPO/.worktrees/bestofn-"* 2>/dev/null
git -C "$MAIN_REPO" for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/bestofn/
ls "$MAIN_REPO/.opencode/bestofn-state/" 2>/dev/null
# If any stale: report to user, ask: clean / abort / proceed-keeping-stale

# 7. Verify .worktrees/ is gitignored in user's project (delegate to using-git-worktrees skill if not)

# 8. Verify .opencode/ is gitignored (add the line and commit if missing)
grep -q '^\.opencode/' "$MAIN_REPO/.gitignore" || {
  echo '.opencode/' >> "$MAIN_REPO/.gitignore"
  git -C "$MAIN_REPO" add .gitignore
  git -C "$MAIN_REPO" commit -m "chore: gitignore .opencode/ ephemeral state"
}
```

## Phase 1 — Worktree Setup

```bash
mkdir -p "$MAIN_REPO/.opencode/bestofn-state"

# Initialize state file
STATE_FILE="$MAIN_REPO/.opencode/bestofn-state/${TASK_ID}.json"
cat > "$STATE_FILE" <<EOF
{
  "task_id": "${TASK_ID}",
  "slug": "${SLUG}",
  "timestamp": "${TS}",
  "base_branch": "${BASE_BRANCH}",
  "base_worktree_path": "${BASE_WORKTREE}",
  "main_repo_path": "${MAIN_REPO}",
  "candidates": [],
  "judge_state": {"phase": "setup"},
  "phase": "setup",
  "started_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "last_updated": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
}
EOF

# Create 4 worktrees
for variant in alpha beta gamma delta; do
  WORKTREE_PATH="$MAIN_REPO/.worktrees/bestofn-${TASK_ID}/${variant}"
  CANDIDATE_BRANCH="bestofn/${TASK_ID}/${variant}"
  git -C "$MAIN_REPO" worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b "$CANDIDATE_BRANCH" "$BASE_BRANCH"
  # Update STATE_FILE candidates array with {variant, worktree_path, branch_name, status="setup"}
done
```

## Phase 2 — Candidate Dispatch

Use the `task` tool 4 times in parallel from a single orchestrator turn.
Each call passes the candidate prompt template (see
`candidate-prompt-template.md`) with these substitutions:

- `{VARIANT}` -> alpha / beta / gamma / delta
- `{TASK_ID}` -> the generated task ID
- `{WORKTREE_PATH}` -> absolute path to that variant's worktree
- `{CANDIDATE_BRANCH}` -> bestofn/<task-id>/<variant>
- `{TASK_SPEC}` -> the full task specification provided by the user
- `{TEST_COMMAND}` -> autodetected (e.g. `pnpm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`)
- `{LINT_COMMAND}` -> autodetected (e.g. `pnpm lint`, `ruff check .`)
- `{BASE_BRANCH}` -> the captured base branch name

```
parallel:
  task(subagent_type="fixer-alpha",
       description="best-of-N candidate alpha for ${SLUG}",
       prompt=<filled candidate-prompt-template>)
  task(subagent_type="fixer-beta",  ...)
  task(subagent_type="fixer-gamma", ...)
  task(subagent_type="fixer-delta", ...)

await all 4 to complete
update state phase = "candidates-returned"
```

## Phase 3 — Hard-Gate Filter

For each candidate worktree, run tests + lint and check non-empty diff:

```bash
for variant in alpha beta gamma delta; do
  WORKTREE_PATH="$MAIN_REPO/.worktrees/bestofn-${TASK_ID}/${variant}"

  cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"

  # tests
  if ! eval "${TEST_COMMAND}"; then
    mark candidate failed-tests
    continue
  fi

  # lint
  if ! eval "${LINT_COMMAND}"; then
    mark candidate failed-lint
    continue
  fi

  # diff exists
  if [[ -z "$(git diff "$BASE_BRANCH"..HEAD)" ]]; then
    mark candidate empty-diff
    continue
  fi

  mark candidate passed-hardgate
done

cd "$BASE_WORKTREE"
update state phase = "hardgate-filtered"
```

Decisions:
- 0 passed -> jump to Phase 6b (redo) with feedback "all candidates failed hard gate".
- 1 passed -> jump to Phase 7 (land winner) — no judging needed.
- 2+ passed -> proceed to Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — Blind Oracle Review

Compute per-candidate diff text, build per-reviewer label-shuffle map,
fill judge-prompt-template.md, dispatch 4 oracles in parallel.

```bash
for variant in <passed_candidates>; do
  CANDIDATE_BRANCH="bestofn/${TASK_ID}/${variant}"
  CANDIDATE_DIFF[$variant]="$(git -C "$MAIN_REPO" diff "$BASE_BRANCH".."$CANDIDATE_BRANCH")"
done
```

Per-reviewer label shuffling (anti-bias):

```python
# pseudo
import random
real_variants = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta']
for reviewer in ['oracle-alpha', 'oracle-beta', 'oracle-gamma', 'oracle-delta']:
    shuffled = random.sample(real_variants, len(real_variants))
    label_map[reviewer] = dict(zip(['A','B','C','D'], shuffled))
    # i.e. when oracle-alpha says "Verdict: merge candidate A",
    # the orchestrator looks up label_map['oracle-alpha']['A'] to get real variant
```

Dispatch:

```
parallel:
  task(subagent_type="oracle-alpha",
       description="best-of-N reviewer alpha for ${SLUG}",
       prompt=<filled judge-prompt-template with shuffled labels>)
  task(subagent_type="oracle-beta",  ...shuffled differently...)
  task(subagent_type="oracle-gamma", ...shuffled differently...)
  task(subagent_type="oracle-delta", ...shuffled differently...)

await all 4
update state phase = "oracle-reviews-returned"
```

## Phase 5 — Vote Aggregation (orchestrator-internal turn)

```
votes = []
for each oracle response:
  parse the LAST line of the response
  expect format "Verdict: merge candidate <X>" or "Verdict: none of these are mergeable"
  if matches "merge candidate <X>":
    real_variant = label_map[reviewer_id][X]
    votes.append(real_variant)
  elif matches "none of these are mergeable":
    votes.append("none")
  else:
    votes.append("malformed")
    log warning, treat as "none"

count_by_variant = Counter(v for v in votes if v not in ("none", "malformed"))
none_count = sum(1 for v in votes if v in ("none", "malformed"))
```

Decision tree:

```
if none_count >= 3:
  -> Phase 6b (redo)
elif max(count_by_variant.values()) >= 3:
  winner = argmax(count_by_variant)
  -> Phase 7 (land)
elif max(count_by_variant.values()) == 2 and only-one-variant-has-2:
  winner = that variant
  -> Phase 7 (land)
else:
  # split: 2-2, 2-1-1, 1-1-1-1, etc
  -> Phase 6a (council arbitration)
```

Update state with full oracle responses, votes, decision.

## Phase 6a — Council Arbitration (split votes only)

Dispatch `@council` once with the full context:

```
task(subagent_type="council",
     description="best-of-N tiebreaker for ${SLUG}",
     prompt="""
You are arbitrating a best-of-N tiebreaker. The 4 oracle reviewers
voted with no clear majority. You must pick a single winner or
declare 'none' to trigger redo.

Task spec:
{TASK_SPEC}

Candidate diffs (4 candidates):
{ALL_4_DIFFS}

Oracle reviews (full text from each reviewer, including their verdicts):
{ALL_4_ORACLE_RESPONSES}

Vote tally:
{VOTE_BREAKDOWN}

Conclude with a single line: 'Verdict: merge candidate <variant>' or
'Verdict: none -> redo'.
""")

await council response
parse final Verdict line
update state with council decision

if council picked a variant:
  winner = that variant
  -> Phase 7 (land)
else:
  -> Phase 6b (redo)
```

## Phase 6b — Redo Loop (no winner)

```
read max_redos from skill config (default 1)
read current redo_count from state (initially 0)

if redo_count >= max_redos:
  -> ESCALATE to user. Print:
     - Task spec
     - All candidate diffs
     - All oracle reviews
     - Council verdict if any
     - Ask user to pick manually or abort.
  -> Phase 8 (cleanup) regardless of user choice.
  -> Skill exits.

redo_count += 1
update state phase = "redo-${redo_count}"

# Aggregate feedback
per_candidate_feedback = {}
shared_feedback_patterns = []

for variant in [alpha, beta, gamma, delta]:
  per_candidate_feedback[variant] = concat all oracle critiques specific to this candidate
  (extracted from each oracle's structured Strengths/Issues sections)

shared_feedback_patterns = find issues that >=2 oracles raised across multiple candidates

  task(subagent_type="fixer-gamma", ...)
  task(subagent_type="fixer-delta", ...)

await all 4
-> back to Phase 3 (hard-gate filter)
```

## Phase 7 — Winner Landing

```bash

## Phase 8 — Cleanup (UNCONDITIONAL)

Cleanup runs regardless of whether the prior phases succeeded, failed,
or were aborted. Wrap your skill execution in a try/finally equivalent:
even on errors, complete this phase before exiting.

```bash
# Read state for the registry
read STATE_FILE

# Loop with retry ladder per candidate
for candidate in state.candidates:
  WORKTREE_PATH = candidate.worktree_path
  CANDIDATE_BRANCH = candidate.branch_name

  # Worktree removal ladder
  if git -C "$MAIN_REPO" worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"; then
    : # NORMAL succeeded
  elif git -C "$MAIN_REPO" worktree remove --force "$WORKTREE_PATH"; then
    : # FORCE succeeded
  elif rm -rf "$WORKTREE_PATH" && git -C "$MAIN_REPO" worktree prune; then
    : # PRUNE succeeded
  else
    add to escalation list
    continue
  fi

  # Branch deletion ladder
  if git -C "$MAIN_REPO" branch -D "$CANDIDATE_BRANCH"; then
    : # NORMAL succeeded
  elif {
    other_worktree=$(git -C "$MAIN_REPO" worktree list | grep "$CANDIDATE_BRANCH" | awk '{print $1}')
    [[ -n "$other_worktree" ]] && \
    git -C "$MAIN_REPO" worktree remove --force "$other_worktree" && \
    git -C "$MAIN_REPO" branch -D "$CANDIDATE_BRANCH"
  }; then
    : # RECOVER succeeded
  else
    add to escalation list
  fi
done

# Remove parent directory if empty
PARENT_DIR="$MAIN_REPO/.worktrees/bestofn-${TASK_ID}"
rmdir "$PARENT_DIR" 2>/dev/null  # ignore failure (means user added files; warn)
if [[ -d "$PARENT_DIR" ]]; then
  echo "WARNING: $PARENT_DIR not empty after cleanup. Inspect manually."
fi

# Final prune
git -C "$MAIN_REPO" worktree prune

# SWEEP 2 — verify nothing left
remaining_worktrees="$(git -C "$MAIN_REPO" worktree list | grep "bestofn-${TASK_ID}")"
remaining_branches="$(git -C "$MAIN_REPO" for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' "refs/heads/bestofn/${TASK_ID}/")"

if [[ -n "$remaining_worktrees" || -n "$remaining_branches" ]]; then
  add all to escalation list
fi

# Delete state file on success; preserve on failure for diagnosis
if [[ ${#escalation_list[@]} -eq 0 ]]; then
  rm "$STATE_FILE"
else
  # Preserve state, log failures
  cat >> "$MAIN_REPO/.opencode/bestofn-failed-cleanups.log" <<EOF
[$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)] Task ${TASK_ID} cleanup escalation:
${escalation_list[@]}
EOF
  print red banner with manual cleanup commands (see "Manual Escape Hatch" below)
fi
```

## Manual Escape Hatch

If the skill itself crashes or hangs, you can clean up manually:

```bash
# Discovery
git worktree list | grep bestofn-
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/bestofn/

# Forced cleanup
for w in $(git worktree list --porcelain | grep -A1 'bestofn-' | grep '^worktree ' | cut -d' ' -f2); do
  git worktree remove --force "$w"
done

for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/bestofn/); do
  git branch -D "$b"
done

git worktree prune
rm -rf .worktrees/bestofn-* .opencode/bestofn-state/
```

## Pre-flight Sweep on Skill Load

Whenever the skill is loaded for a fresh fan-out, run discovery on
stale state from prior runs (interrupted skill runs leave residue):

```bash
stale_state_files="$(ls "$MAIN_REPO/.opencode/bestofn-state/"*.json 2>/dev/null)"
stale_worktrees="$(ls -d "$MAIN_REPO/.worktrees/bestofn-"* 2>/dev/null)"
stale_branches="$(git -C "$MAIN_REPO" for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/bestofn/)"

if [[ -n "$stale_state_files" || -n "$stale_worktrees" || -n "$stale_branches" ]]; then
  print "Found stale best-of-N state from prior interrupted run(s):"
  print stale items
  ask user: clean now / abort / proceed-keeping-stale
fi
```

## Ideation Sub-Mode (brainstorming Phase 4)

When invoked from brainstorming's "propose 2-3 approaches" step,
this skill runs a stripped-down ideation fan-out:

- No worktrees, no branches, no candidate fixer dispatch.
- Read-only: dispatches `oracle-alpha`, `librarian-alpha`,
  `explorer-alpha`, `designer-alpha` in parallel.
- Each returns 1-2 candidate approaches from its lens (architectural,
  prior-art, codebase-realism, UX).
- Orchestrator dedupes, summarizes, presents to user as part of normal
  brainstorming Phase 4.
- No judging, no winner, no cleanup needed.

This sub-mode is purely an ideation diversifier; do not confuse with
the implementation fan-out above.

## Configuration

Override defaults via skill invocation context:

| Config key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `max_redos` | `1` | Maximum redo rounds before escalating to user |
| `enable_label_shuffle` | `true` | Anti-bias label shuffling for oracles |
| `min_passed_candidates` | `2` | If fewer pass hard gate, treat as no-winner |
| `commit_style` | `cherry-pick-or-squash` | Alternative: `merge-commit` (preserves candidate branch in log) |

## Red Flags — DO NOT

- Do not skip Phase 0 sweep — interrupted runs leave residue you cannot see otherwise.
- Do not let cwd discipline drift — fixers must use absolute paths in tool calls.
- Do not auto-trigger best-of-N for routine bounded tasks. It is opt-in.
- Do not preserve "interesting losers" — cleanup is unconditional.
- Do not fan out on dirty WC — refuse and ask user to commit/stash.
- Do not allow infinite redo — hard cap (default 1, max 3).

## Integration

**Pairs with:**
- `using-git-worktrees` — for `.worktrees/` gitignore enforcement
- `dispatching-parallel-agents` — for the parallel-task discipline
- `requesting-code-review` — for the single-candidate review template
- `verification-before-completion` — for post-land verification

**Replaces:** nothing. Best-of-N is opt-in alongside existing flows.

## Worked Example

User: "We need to refactor the auth module to use JWT. Run best-of-N
on this — high-stakes, multiple plausible designs."

Orchestrator (you):
1. Recognize fan-out trigger.
2. Load this skill.
3. Phase 0:
   - git rev-parse --git-dir -> ok
   - git status --porcelain -> empty, ok
   - MAIN_REPO=/path/to/main
   - BASE_BRANCH=feature/auth-refactor
   - SLUG=auth-jwt-refactor, TS=202605041534, TASK_ID=auth-jwt-refactor-202605041534
   - Sweep finds nothing stale.
4. Phase 1: Create 4 worktrees + branches + state file.
5. Phase 2: Dispatch fixer-alpha through fixer-delta in parallel with the
   spec "refactor auth module to use JWT, see docs/auth-spec.md".
6. Phase 3: Run npm test + npm run lint in each. 3 of 4 pass.
   Candidate gamma fails tests (chose JWT lib that conflicts with existing TLS layer).
7. Phase 4: Build per-reviewer label maps. Dispatch oracle-alpha through
   oracle-delta in parallel with the 3 passing candidates' diffs.
8. Phase 5: Read responses. Votes: alpha, alpha, beta, alpha. -> 3-1 majority.
   Winner: alpha.
9. Phase 7: cd back to feature/auth-refactor, cherry-pick winner alpha's commit.
   Tests pass post-land.
10. Phase 8: git worktree remove all 4, git branch -D all 4, rmdir parent,
    git worktree prune, sweep clean. State file deleted.

User sees: clean WC except the new alpha commit, with descriptive message
including vote breakdown.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Verify SKILL.md is well-formed**

```powershell
# Confirm frontmatter is valid YAML
$content = Get-Content "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\skills\best-of-n-with-judge\SKILL.md" -Raw
if ($content -match '^---\r?\n[\s\S]+?\r?\n---') {
  Write-Output "Frontmatter present"
} else {
  Write-Error "Frontmatter missing or malformed"
}
```

Expected: `Frontmatter present`

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/best-of-n-with-judge/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat(best-of-n): add core best-of-n-with-judge skill methodology"
```

---

## Task 13: Smoke Test 1 — Variant Agent Registration

This task verifies that opencode loads the 16 new variant agents and
that the `task` tool can route to them by name.

**Files:**
- Test: (no file; integration test in opencode session)

- [ ] **Step 1: Restart opencode session if currently running**

```powershell
# Close any active opencode session, then start fresh:
# (in a new terminal)
# opencode
```

- [ ] **Step 2: In a fresh opencode session, ask the orchestrator to list known agents**

Type into opencode session:

```
List all agents you can dispatch via the task tool, including hidden ones.
Return a bullet list of agent names only, no descriptions.
```

Expected: Output includes (at minimum) all 16 of:
- fixer-alpha, fixer-beta, fixer-gamma, fixer-delta
- oracle-alpha, oracle-beta, oracle-gamma, oracle-delta
- designer-alpha, designer-beta, designer-gamma, designer-delta
- explorer-alpha, explorer-beta
- librarian-alpha, librarian-beta

If any are missing, check `~/.config/opencode/agents/<missing>.md`
exists and frontmatter is valid YAML.

- [ ] **Step 3: Round-trip test for fixer-alpha**

In the opencode session:

```
Dispatch task(subagent_type="fixer-alpha", description="ping test",
prompt="Reply with the single word 'pong' and nothing else. Do not use any tools.")
```

Expected: orchestrator successfully dispatches; the response from
fixer-alpha contains the word "pong".

If routing fails ("subagent_type not found" or similar), check:
- frontmatter `mode: subagent` present
- `hidden: true` does not block task tool (it shouldn't, per docs)
- `model:` field references a registered provider in `opencode.json`

- [ ] **Step 4: Round-trip test for one variant per family**

Repeat Step 3 for: oracle-alpha, designer-alpha, explorer-alpha,
librarian-alpha. All five should respond.

- [ ] **Step 5: Document any failures**

If any variant fails to respond, write findings to a smoke-test log
at `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\docs\plans\2026-05-04-best-of-n-smoke-test.md`
and resolve before proceeding.

- [ ] **Step 6: No commit unless smoke-test log was written**

```bash
# Only if the smoke-test log was written:
git add docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-smoke-test.md
git commit -m "test(best-of-n): smoke test 1 results"
```

---

## Task 14: Smoke Test 2 — Skill Discoverability + Pre-flight Dry Run

**Files:**
- Test: integration test in opencode session

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify skill is auto-discovered**

In opencode session:

```
List all available skills you can load. The list should include
'best-of-n-with-judge'.
```

Expected: `best-of-n-with-judge` appears.

- [ ] **Step 2: Trigger the skill explicitly**

```
Load the best-of-n-with-judge skill. Read its SKILL.md content
and confirm you understand its 9 phases (Phase 0 through Phase 8
plus the ideation sub-mode). Do NOT actually start a fan-out.
Just summarize the phases in 2 sentences each.
```

Expected: orchestrator returns a 9-section summary matching the
skill's actual phase pipeline.

- [ ] **Step 3: Dry-run pre-flight in a real git project**

Choose a small test project (e.g. a fresh `git init` repo with
one trivial file). In opencode session at that project's cwd:

```
Run only Phase 0 (pre-flight) of the best-of-n-with-judge skill
for the hypothetical task "add a hello-world function". Report
which checks passed/failed. Do NOT proceed to Phase 1.
```

Expected:
- git rev-parse: passes
- WC clean check: passes (assuming clean test repo)
- main_repo resolution: passes
- Sweep: reports zero stale items
- gitignore checks: may report `.opencode/` not ignored (the skill
  should auto-add it and commit; verify the commit was made)

- [ ] **Step 4: Inspect the auto-added .gitignore commit**

```bash
git -C <test-repo> log --oneline -1
```

Expected: a commit like `chore: gitignore .opencode/ ephemeral state`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Document smoke test 2 results**

Append to `docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-smoke-test.md`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit if log changed**

```bash
git add docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-smoke-test.md
git commit -m "test(best-of-n): smoke test 2 results"
```

---

## Task 15: Smoke Test 3 — End-to-End on a Trivial Task

This is the critical integration test. Run a real fan-out on a
small, deterministic task.

**Files:**
- Test: integration test in opencode session, in a temp git repo

- [ ] **Step 1: Set up a minimal test project**

```powershell
$temp = "C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp\opencode\bestofn-smoke-test"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $temp -Force
cd $temp
git init
"# test" | Out-File -FilePath README.md
"node_modules/" | Out-File -FilePath .gitignore
git add .
git commit -m "init"

# Create a trivial node project
'{"name":"smoke","version":"0.0.1","scripts":{"test":"node test.js","lint":"true"}}' | Out-File -FilePath package.json
'console.log("placeholder");' | Out-File -FilePath test.js
git add . && git commit -m "trivial project"

# Create a fixable thing
'function greet(){ return "hi"; }; module.exports = { greet };' | Out-File -FilePath src.js
'const {greet} = require("./src.js"); if(greet() !== "hello") {process.exit(1);}' | Out-File -FilePath test.js
git add . && git commit -m "broken: greet returns wrong value"
```

The test should fail before any fix; the task is to make it pass.

- [ ] **Step 2: Trigger best-of-N from opencode**

In opencode session at the test project cwd:

```
Run best-of-N on this task: "Fix src.js so that the test in test.js
passes. The greet() function should return 'hello' instead of 'hi'."

Use 4 fixer variants and 4 oracle variants. max_redos=0 (no redo
loop, fail fast for smoke testing).
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Observe phases**

Watch terminal output. You should see (in order):
- Phase 0 pre-flight messages
- Phase 1 worktree creation (4 dirs under .worktrees/bestofn-*)
- Phase 2 parallel fixer dispatches
- Phase 3 hard-gate filter (likely all 4 pass since the fix is trivial)
- Phase 4 oracle reviews
- Phase 5 vote tally (likely unanimous since the fix is uncontroversial)
- Phase 7 cherry-pick of winner
- Phase 8 cleanup (worktrees and branches removed)

- [ ] **Step 4: Verify post-conditions**

```bash
cd $temp
git log --oneline                    # should show: original setup commits + 0-2 gitignore enforcement commits added by pre-flight + 1 best-of-N winner commit. Counts depend on initial .gitignore state. T3 reference run produced 3 commits total (1 init + 1 .worktrees gitignore + 1 winner).
git status --porcelain               # should be empty
git worktree list                    # should show only the main worktree
git for-each-ref refs/heads/bestofn/ # should be empty
ls .worktrees/                       # should be empty or not exist
ls .opencode/bestofn-state/          # should be empty (state file deleted on success)
node test.js                         # should now exit 0
```

All should hold. Pre-flight may auto-commit gitignore additions for `.opencode/` and/or `.worktrees/` if those paths were not already ignored — these are expected and intentional.

- [ ] **Step 5: Inspect the winning commit message**

```bash
git log -1 --format=%B
```

Expected: contains "Best-of-N selection from 4 candidates", winner
variant name, vote tally, "Generated via best-of-n-with-judge skill".

- [ ] **Step 6: Test cleanup escape hatch**

In a separate test, kill opencode mid-Phase-4 (during oracle reviews):
- Verify `.worktrees/bestofn-*/` directories exist
- Restart opencode in same project
- Trigger best-of-N again with same task slug
- Skill's pre-flight sweep should detect stale state and prompt

- [ ] **Step 7: Document smoke test 3 results**

Append final results to `docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-smoke-test.md`
including timing data: how long fan-out took, how many tokens used.

- [ ] **Step 8: Clean up test project**

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp\opencode\bestofn-smoke-test"
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit smoke test log**

```bash
cd C:/Users/Administrator/.config/opencode
git add docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-smoke-test.md
git commit -m "test(best-of-n): end-to-end smoke test passing"
```

---

## Task 16: Update Documentation README and Optionally Push

**Files:**
- Modify: `C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\README.md` (if exists; otherwise create)

- [ ] **Step 1: Check if README exists**

```powershell
Test-Path "C:\Users\Administrator\.config\opencode\README.md"
```

If false, skip the modify step and create instead.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add a section about best-of-n-with-judge**

Append (or write fresh) the following section:

```markdown
## Best-of-N with Judge

This config installs a `best-of-n-with-judge` skill that adds
parallel candidate generation + blind oracle review + winner
selection on top of the standard superpowers + omo-slim flow.

**Trigger phrases:** "best of N", "fan out", "tournament",
"parallel candidates".

**Variant agents** are pre-registered in `agents/`:
- `fixer-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}` — code candidate generators
- `oracle-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}` — blind reviewers
- `designer-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}` — UI candidate generators
- `explorer-{alpha,beta}` — parallel reconnaissance
- `librarian-{alpha,beta}` — parallel docs research

**Worktree convention:** candidates land at
`<main-repo>/.worktrees/bestofn-<slug>-<ts>/<variant>/`. Cleanup
is unconditional. State persists at
`<main-repo>/.opencode/bestofn-state/<task-id>.json` until the
fan-out completes.

**Manual cleanup escape hatch:**

```bash
git worktree list | grep bestofn-
for w in $(git worktree list --porcelain | grep -A1 'bestofn-' | grep '^worktree ' | cut -d' ' -f2); do
  git worktree remove --force "$w"
done
for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/bestofn/); do
  git branch -D "$b"
done
git worktree prune
rm -rf .worktrees/bestofn-* .opencode/bestofn-state/
```

**Spec & plan:**
- Spec: `docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-with-judge-design.md`
- Plan: `docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-with-judge-plan.md`

**Variant model assignments** are defaults in each variant agent's
frontmatter. Edit `agents/<base>-<variant>.md` `model:` field to
re-tune.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs(best-of-n): document best-of-n-with-judge skill in README"
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Merge feature branch (optional, if you want to land it on main)**

```bash
git checkout main           # or your default branch
git merge --no-ff feature/best-of-n-with-judge -m "feat: add best-of-n-with-judge skill"
git branch -d feature/best-of-n-with-judge
```

---

## Self-Review Checklist (run before declaring plan complete)

After implementing all tasks, verify:

- [ ] All 16 variant agent markdown files exist under `agents/`.
- [ ] All 5 base prompt files exist under `prompts/`.
- [ ] `skills/best-of-n-with-judge/` contains `SKILL.md` and 3 prompt templates.
- [ ] `oracle_append.md` contains the "Multi-candidate review" section.
- [ ] `orchestrator_append.md` contains the "Best-of-N awareness" section.
- [ ] All three smoke tests passed and were logged.
- [ ] `git log` shows clean per-task commits, no squashed mess.
- [ ] No leftover `.worktrees/bestofn-*` or `bestofn/*` branches in this config repo.

## Risks and Mitigations

(Carried forward from the design doc, see
`docs/plans/2026-05-04-best-of-n-with-judge-design.md` Section 11.)

The biggest risk during implementation is R1 (cwd discipline failure
poisoning the main repo). Smoke Test 3 is specifically designed to
catch this — if any post-condition in Task 15 Step 4 fails, halt and
diagnose before declaring success.

---

End of plan.
